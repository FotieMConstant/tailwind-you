## Get Multiple Quotes by Known Authors

### Endpoint

### Description

This endpoint allows you to retrieve multiple quotes by known authors. You can specify the number of quotes to retrieve by providing the `count` parameter in the URL.

### Request

- **Method**: GET

#### Parameters

- `count` (required): The number of quotes to retrieve. It should be a positive integer.

### Example Request

```http
GET /v1/quote/filter/known/5
```

### Response

#### Success Response (200 OK)

- **Content-Type**: application/json

```json
{
  "quotes": [
    {
      "author": "Author Name",
      "text": "Quote text 1"
    },
    {
      "author": "Author Name",
      "text": "Quote text 2"
    },
    // Additional quotes...
  ]
}
```

#### Error Response

- **Content-Type**: application/json

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid parameter value for 'count'. 'count' must be a positive integer."
}
```

### Example Usage

**JavaScript (fetch):**

```javascript
fetch("/v1/quote/filter/known/3")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    // Handle the retrieved quotes here
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

**cURL:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-api-domain.com/v1/quote/filter/known/3"
```

### Notes

- Replace `:count` in the URL with the desired number of quotes to retrieve.
- Ensure that the `count` parameter is a positive integer; otherwise, you will receive an error response.
- The response will contain an array of quotes, each with an `author` and `text` property.
